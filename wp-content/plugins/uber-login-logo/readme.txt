A simple, lightweight WordPress plugin to change your login logo.

== Description ==

View the plugin page for more information and discussion: [http://www.uberweb.com.au/uber-login-logo-wordpress-plugin/](http://www.uberweb.com.au/uber-login-logo-wordpress-plugin/)

Uber Login Logo is a simple plugin I made so that I could customise the login screen on my own website by utilising in-built WordPress functions and the WordPress media uploader.
Considering all the bloated plugins and resource intensive implementations floating around, I thought this lightweight codebase and clean UI could be of similar benefit to other WordPress users/developers.
Don't expect too many fancy bells and whistles, this plugin does one thing, and does it well.

== Installation ==

Download and activate from the Plugins page of your WordPress site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will you add X feature? =

I'd like to keep this plugin simple, but if you think you have a good idea leave a comment on the [plugin page](http://www.uberweb.com.au/uber-login-logo-wordpress-plugin/) and I'll at least consider it.

= This plugin does not work on my WordPress installation =

As of 0.5 This plugin makes use of the new media editor introduced in WordPress 3.5.  If you are having issues try installing version 0.4, or better yet, updating your WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. How awesome your login screen could look after using this plugin.
